# Credit card fraud Detection 

# Problem Statement
. In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions based on various features of financial transactions.  
. Its primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can proactively distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions.
. The exploration of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, aims to identify the most effective approach for fraud detection.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
.Identify fraudulent transactions: Using a machine learning model, we aim to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
